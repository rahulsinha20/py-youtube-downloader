Add: ptions = {

(2) JPEG,ICO, other image formats not rendered in the app
py2exe does not bundle the <dist> with image processing capabilities apart from PNG!
and as such we need to move the following dlls from:
qgif4.dll
qico4.dll
qjpeg4.dll
qmng4.dll
qsvg4.dll
qtiff4.dll
<Python Folder>/Lib/site-packages/PyQt4/plugins/imageformats
copy the folder <imageformats> and place it within the <dist> folder
Now the application should be able to render all the images
