(1) Implementation of a Video class to store video details
(2) Videos are now assigned a number which is useful with QNetworkAccessManager
As with this method the calls are not blocked. And so while receiving images back, we should be knowing
on which widget this has to be placed. This is looked up by matching the URL retrieved
with the array of video objects and this allows to have matching attributes i.e thumbnail image matches with title etc
This solves previous problem when the thumbs dont match with their titles etc. This was
only because of the fact that asynchronous networkAccessManager class returns the image data as and when the links
are downloaded and on the UI we had used a normal counter .i.e the counter was not associated with the image downloaded
and hence confusion!
