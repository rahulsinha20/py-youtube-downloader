## Application Walk-through ##
First time users will be prompted with a configuration editor as shown below:

**Library Path:** This is the folder where all the downloaded files will be stored. A new folder can be created from the same dialog and used as library folder.

**Media Player:** This is the default media player used to play downloaded videos. Use this to specify the executable file location.

**Embedded Player:** The application can play media as embedded videos from its interface. However, it does possess some problems on certain platforms not using Mozilla as a browser. The application relies on the flash plugin that is used with Mozilla.

## Video Search ##
To search for videos, type the keyword that you are looking for in the search box and do not  select "Standard Video Feeds" and press "Search Button" as shown below:

As shown in the screenshot, the videos are shown in a grid view. The videos can be viewed, either by right clicking on the image and selecting View OR double clicking on the video (which does not always work!).

The selected details for the video are shown on the top right pane with details like: Title, Duration, Category, Published date. The videos can be played from the Embedded Video pane as shown below:

## Standard Video Feeds ##
Standard video feeds **(1) Most Viewed (2) Top Rated (3) Recently featured (4) Most Discussed (5) Top Favorites (6) Most Responded (7) Most Recent**

A shown in the screenshot on the left, for standard feeds there is no keyword that can be used, just select the feed that you are interested in and click Search button.

## Direct Video Links ##
Cannot find a video that you wish to download? You could paste your direct link for the video and the application will try downloading it. Note: not all videos from other sources can be downloaded; all youtube links will be OK to download unless they are copyrighted.

## Play Downloaded Videos ##
Downloaded videos are added to the folder as selected before as the **Media Library** folder. Every downloaded video has a subfolder named after the **keyword** that you searched for OR the name of the standard feed. The video name is the name of the video.

In case of direct video links, the folder name is **Direct Downloads** and video name is the title used for identifying the direct video link (as shown above).

### Video Library View ###
Video Library has the following three main components **(1) root node** – identified by "Video Library" in the view **(2) Folder node** – downloaded videos have their own separate folders (more later), **(3) Video node** – this is the actual video item that can be played.
